# Lab 400: Replicate process configuration
​
Continuing from lab300, let's configure the replicate process on the target Goldengate version 18.
![](screenshots/20.png)
​
run the following command to open the console for Goldengate version 18
```
ggsci oracle18
```

Before we set up the GoldenGate replicat process, we need to do the following 3 pre-configurations inside ggsci console:
1. configure dynamic ports for the Goldengate manager;
check the current port for Goldengate manager, the default value for the Goldengate 18 here is 10018, make sure it's consistent with the number we used for pump paramater in lab 300
```
view param mgr
```
then, stop the manager process, edit its parameter,
```
stop mgr
edit param mgr
```
add a DYNAMICPORTLIST param into it, so it looks like this
```
PORT 10018
DYNAMICPORTLIST 10020-10030
```
save it and restart the manager process, check if manager is running
```
start mgr
info all
```
2. configure the GLOBALS parameter;
When we configured the pump process in lab300, we defined the path '/home/opc/oracle18/dirdat/' as the target location for pumping trail files to Goldengate 18. To make sure the Goldengate 18 allows using this folder, we need to specify this path in Goldengate 18's GLOBALS enviroment.
use create&open the GLOBALS parameter file:
```
edit param ./GLOBALS
```
Add this line to the file
```
ALLOWOUTPUTDIR /home/opc/oracle18/dirdat/
```
save this GLOBALS file, and a param file called GLOBALS will be generated under /home/opc/oracle18 folder.

3. create the checkpointtable for the GoldenGate users in target ADW; 

login the target ADW using the useridalias we created in lab200
```
dblogin useridalias ADW
```
create checkpointtable under the Goldengate user
```
add checkpointtable ggadmin.checkpointtable
```

Now we can start creating the replicat process
Configure a replicat process (we name it REP here)
```
edit param REP
```
input the following contents
```
Replicat REP
ASSUMETARGETDEFS
USERIDALIAS  ADW
MAP ggadmin.CHANNELS, TARGET ggadmin.CHANNELS;
```
here, "replicat REP" defines the process type and name;

"ASSUMETARGETDEFS", since the source table "CHANNELS" and the target table "CHANNELS" are the same structure, using this parameter directs Oracle GoldenGate to assume that the data definitions of the source and target objects are identical, and to refer to the target definitions when metadata is needed for the source data. When source and target tables have dissimilar structures, do not use ASSUMETARGETDEFS ;

"useridalias ADW" is the login credential to the target ADW;

"MAP ggadmin.CHANNELS, TARGET ggadmin.CHANNELS;" defines where to deliver the table changes;

save this param file


Configure Replicate process
```
add replicat REP, exttrail /home/opc/oracle18/dirdat/cc, begin now, checkpointtable ggadmin.checkpointtable
```
The above command adds this replicat process to goldengate manager, tell the system it will use this file: "/home/opc/oracle18/dirdat/cc" as external source;

Now we have finished configuration for extract, pump and replicat processes,  next let's start the pipeline and do some Goldengate testing in the next lab:
