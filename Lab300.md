# Lab 300: Extract and Pump processes configuration	

Continuing from lab200, to set up the GoldenGate extract process, we need to add trandata and create the checkpointtable for the GoldenGate users, so let's login source database and run these commands.

```
dblogin useridalias DB11G
add schematrandata ggadmin
add checkpointtable ggadmin.checkpointable
```
Now the source side is ready, we can start creating extact process.
Use this command to create and configure an Extract process. 
(Here we name our extract process EXT, note that the name cannot exceed 8 characters)
```
edit param EXT (INSERT SCREENSHOT)
```
input the following contents
```
extract EXT
TRANLOGOPTIONS DBLOGREADER
useridalias DB11G
exttrail ./dirdat/EX
table ggadmin.CHANNELS;
```
here, "extract EXT" defines the process type and name;

"TRANLOGOPTIONS DBLOGREADER" is the tran option applied;

"useridalias DB11G" is the login credential to the data source;

"exttrail ./dirdat/EX" defines the external trail file name and path;

"table ggadmin.CHANNELS;" defines the schema and table we want to synchronize (note that a ';' is required at the end);

save this param file, (From the above process, a param file called ext.prm will be generated inside ./dirprm/ folder)




We have the extract parameter ready, let's add it into goldengate:
```
add extract EXT, tranlog, begin now
add exttrail ./dirdat/aa, extract EXT
```
Configure Pump process
```
edit param PMP (INSERT SCREENSHOT)
add extract PMP, exttrailsource /home/opc/oracle11/dirdat/aa, begin now
add rmttrail /home/opc/oracle18/dirdat/cc, extract PMP

stop/start mgr
```
