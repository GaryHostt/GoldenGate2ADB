# Lab 200: Setup connections to Source DB and target DB

## 1. Configure the environment variable for Source DB connection

Begin by ssh-ing to the GG admin server, then you will set up the environment variables so you can create the connection credentials to the source database (11G). After you set up the $ORACLE_HOME, $TNS_ADMIN and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, create the tnsnames.ora file that contains the database connection details. 

Go to your database system to get the connection information (screenshot)
(DESCRIPTION=(CONNECT_TIMEOUT=5)(TRANSPORT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=3)(RETRY_COUNT=3)(ADDRESS_LIST=(LOAD_BALANCE=on)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=10.1.1.1)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=GGTestDB_phx1n9.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com)))

Note: the host may use a private IP address or dns name, if so, change it to the public IP address.

Note: Because the source database is 11G, you will need to use GoldenGate 11G here.
```
cd /u01/app/client/oracle11
Mkdir -p network/admin (DON’T NEED TO MKDIR; already exists)
cd network/admin
Create a tnsnames.ora file here (under the admin folder). 
	vi tnsnames.ora

Create a service name “DB11G” pointing to the source database:
DB11G=(DESCRIPTION=(CONNECT_TIMEOUT=5)(TRANSPORT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=3)(RETRY_COUNT=3)(ADDRESS_LIST=(LOAD_BALANCE=on)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=123.123.123.123)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=GGTest_phx123.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com)))

```
Note: Esc, :wq is how you save and exit vi

Configure your .bash_profile by running this vi command, and adding the 3 export lines at the bottom. After writing and quitting, run source to permanently add those environment variables on the GoldenGate admin compute node. 
```
$ vi ~/.bash_profile 
 			 							
export ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/client/oracle11
export TNS_ADMIN=/u01/app/client/oracle11/network/admin 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u01/app/client/oracle11/lib 		
				 							
$ source ~/.bash_profile 
```
## 2. Create Source DB connection in GoldenGate 11
```
ggsci oracle11
Stop mgr    
Start mgr   (restart mgr, so mgr process can get the env variables just configured)
```
Create user credential
```
add credentialstore
alter credentialstore add user ggadmin@DB11G password WELcome__12345 alias GG_DB11G domain OracleGoldenGate
```
Test this connection 
```
dblogin useridalias GG_DB11G
```

## 3. Configure the env variable for Target ADW connection
ssh to the GG admin server
Note: You need to check to database version of you ADW first. It could be version 18 or version 19. Because the target ADW for demo is version 18, you will need to use GoldenGate 18 here.

Create connection credentials to target db

Create $TNS_ADMIN folder (network/admin) and copy the wallet file here
```	
cd /u01/app/client/oracle18
Mkdir -p network/admin (DON’T NEED TO MKDIR; already exists)
cd network/admin
cp <path-to-ADW-wallet-file> .
```
Update the path inside sqlnet.ora file, 
```
unzip <ADW-wallet-file> 
vi sqlnet.ora (update the path to wallet files)
```
(Download the wallet file from ADW cloud console)[How to download the wallet File from ADW] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/connect-download-wallet.html#GUID-B06202D2-0597-41AA-9481-3B174F75D4B1)

Configure your bash profile
```
$ vi ~/.bash_profile 
 			 							
export ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/client/oracle18
export TNS_ADMIN=/u01/app/client/oracle18/network/admin 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u01/app/client/oracle18/lib 		
				 							
$ source ~/.bash_profile 
```
##4. Create Target ADW connection credentials in GoldenGate 18
```
Ggsci oracle11
Stop mgr
Start mgr

```
Create username
```
add credentialstore
alter credentialstore add user ggadmin@ADW_low password WELcome__12345 alias GG_ADW
```
Test the connection
```
	dblogin useridalias GG_ADW
```
You can verify the manager processes are started in the source and target databases with 
```
GGSCI> info all
```
