# Lab 500: GoldenGate in-action
​
If you have reached this lab, then you have configured a full GoldenGate migration data sync. All that is left is to monitor your processes to see if they're working correctly. So let's continue.
1. start the pipeline
First, open the Goldengate 11 console
```
ggsci oracle11
```
start the extract and pump process on source side
```
Start *
```
Ensures all extract processes have started
```
info all
```
Ensures each processes is correctly working
```
view report (EXT/PMP)
```
Ensures logging file is created
```
cd oracle11/dirdat/
```
Checks if file exists

Repeat for target side Goldengate version 18
open the console for GG 18
```
ggsci oracle18
```
start the replicat process
```
Start *
```
Ensures all extract processes have started
```
info all
```
Ensures each processes is correctly working
```
view report REP
```

2. data synchronization test

Within SQLDeveloper, connect to both source Oracle 11g database and target ADW.

Make changes in source database

Check if changes synced to target database
```
ggsci oracle18
Command: stats replicat REP
```
