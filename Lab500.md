# Lab 500: GoldenGate in-action
​
If you have reached this lab, then you have configured a full GoldenGate migration data sync. All that is left is to monitor your processes to see if they're working correctly. So let's continue.
```
ggsci oracle11
Start *
```
Ensures all extract processes have started
```
info all
```
Ensures each processes is correctly working
```
view report (EXT/PMP)
```
Ensures logging file is created
```
cd oracle11/dirdat/
```
Checks if file exists
Repeat for oracle18/dirdat/
```
ggsci oracle18
Start *
```
Ensures all extract processes have started
```
info all
```
Ensures each processes is correctly working
```
view report REP
```
Within SQLDeveloper:
```
Make changes in source database
```
Check if changes synced to target database
```
ggsci oracle18
Command: stats replicat REP
```
